                  During my second year of highschool, I was lucky enough to be
                  given the opportunity to take an entry test for an early
                  college program at Montgomery College. I was under the
                  impression that this was meant I would be taking Montgomery
                  College classes at my highschool similar to dual enrollment,
                  but much to my surprise, after passing the test I was told
                  that I would now be attending Montgomery College full time!
                  After getting over the initial surprise, the summer of my
                  highschool sophomore year I went to Montgomery College to get
                  prepared for what would be the upcoming semester. The major I
                  had chosen before entry was Computer Science, so that was the
                  program I prepared for during my summer there. When fall came
                  around, I was attending Montgomery College as a 15 year old.
                  While there I was taking both computer science focused
                  classes, as well as classes to substitute for the classes I
                  would be missing at my highschool. Getting thrust into the
                  college experience so early was certainly a little bit
                  nerve-racking, however in hindsight it was a great learning
                  and character building experience, and I graduated May 2021
                  with both a highschool degree AND an Associates Degree from
                  Montgomery College, there from which I transfered to
                  University of Maryland Baltimore College.

                  After my semesters at Montgomery College, I transfered to
                  University of Maryland Baltimore County, which is where I am
                  currently at. I decided to continue under the Computer Science
                  major, as by this point I had gotten used to it and wanted to
                  continue after school to a career in the field. My time at a
                  "real" university (a place with a more real university
                  feeling) has been very enjoyable, as has been the student and
                  staff body at this school. The early college program has sped
                  up the degree process, making everything feel like its
                  happening at once and the uptick in course difficulty was
                  noticable, but of course, I persevered and as of right now I
                  am on track to graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science
                  in May of 2023 as a 19 year old.
